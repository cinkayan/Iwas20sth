Topic
“I was 20 Something” is a dynamic website that showcases C-Suites’ stories in their 20s. The page applied all four fields of User Experiences.
Problem
There’s a gap between school and society while people are in their 20s. Therefore, there is a need for greatly expanded societal efforts to help them navigate the transition into careers and family.
Target Audience
My Target Audiences are
1.	People who are experiencing their 20s, who has many confusions and uncertainties about the future.
2.	People who are passionate about knowing people’s biography in a multimedia way.

User Stories
Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.
User Story 1:  Lily is in her 20s, who was in her senior year of college. She felt very anxious about the future. When she looked through LinkedIn, she always has a question: What did those “successful” people do in their 20s? Did they work super hard? Did they super clear about what they want to do in the future? Will they have the same confusions as I do? Ah… Why there are no resources online? She is eager to get that information.  

User Story 2: Bob was in his mid 30s. He loves to know people’s stories. He did a lot of readings and watched tons of interviews. But recently, he found that most people who have huge success in their careers, rarely talked about their path to the present self. Most topic they told people in public were centered with their vision of the industry, insights of their company’s new products, their iridescent histories etc. He felt those people were so unreal; he wanted to know their true stories, not just stories shared on the surface.

User Story 3: Lambert, 26, in fact is very curious about his peers. But this is a very sensitive question to ask in person. “Is there anyway that could make people talk about their experiences voluntarily?” People resonate with other people with similar experiences. Therefore, if they heard somebody taking about an experience they can relate to, it’s very likely that they will share their own experiences.
