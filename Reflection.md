This is a project I thought about for a long time. Although integrated the video storyline took me quite a lot of time to figure out, I still did not think this is the hardest part of this project. The hardest part is, how do I evaluate and assess the learning effect? After all, the project does not have any hard criteria.

I thought this was a very meaningful experience, especially with educational purpose. I also believes that it can impact, inspire or influence with those people who are experiencing their 20s. But how do I know if that multimedia information really does help them?
Impact will lead to action. Therefore, I designed a two-step assessment solution. Step one: Thumbs up or down, after viewing the video, do you think this is helpful?
Step two: Are you willing to go a step further? After viewing otherâ€™s reflecting, are you motivated to do a self-reflection? If so, produce a dynamic graphic for you, and write down some words to yourself in the 20s, like the people featured in the website.
The last thing we have to do is to compare the viewing traffic and people who have done the thumbs up/down and graphics.
