                <p>I am the Chairman and CEO of OgilvyOne Worldwide, and I have been with Ogilvy since September 1983.<br>
I have just published my first book, The Long View: Career Strategies to Start Strong, Reach High, and Go Far, in which I share advice on building life-long career strategies for the modern world. </p>

                </h3>
                <p>I joined BBH NY as the agency's first-ever CSO in 2011. I have since transformed strategy and planning at BBH New York with an “all killer no filler” mind-set. Embedding strategy deep into the creative process, I pushes for bigger and more resonant ideas across all media, with tremendous results. Over the years, my strategic excellence led to the creation of award winning work for clients like PlayStation, Netflix,
Seamless, Johnnie Walker and Cole Haan.</p>
